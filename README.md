## Digital Craftsman (Software Developer)

I'm a full-time student currently studying EVIT Level 3 at college with an inspiring ambition to become a Software Developer. I created this GitHub to show **YOU** what I can do and how I can build my own digital world. I have experience with many different coding languages and have experience using many different tools such as:

- VSCode
- Photoshop
- Word
- PowerPoint
- Excel
- Unreal Engine
- Premier Pro
- DaVinci Resolve
- Visual Studio

I always wish to be the best that I can be, and I'm more than happy to listen, learn, and improve.
